When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

                Amazon Athena a serverless query service that uses Amazon S3 as its data source. The service is ideal for the scenario due to the ad hoc nature of the query task, thus building a database is unnecessary. The service does not need to build databases on dedicated Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, instead, it builds tables from data read directly from Amazon S3 bucket.

                Amazon Athena a serverless query service that does not need to build databases on dedicated Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, instead, it builds tables from data read directly from Amazon S3 buckets. Amazon Athena does not store any of the data. The service is compatible with the regular data formats that include CSV, JSON, ORC, AVRO and Parquet.

                AWS Config will meet the requirements of the scenario, the service allows the administrator to monitor and record configuration changes on AWS resources in their account. The service also allows the administrator to create a resource configuration inventory.

                AWS Config can be used to keep track of configuration changes on AWS resources, keeping multiple date-stamped versions in a reviewable history. This makes it the best method to meet the scenario requirements.

                Using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language understanding (NLU), Amazon Macie has the capability to read documents and sift through user data for sensitive or vulnerable information that can be exploited. Information such as credit/debit card numbers, access keys in documents will trigger an alert. Amazon Macie integrates with Amazon CloudTrail to detect unusual access patterns to user data and alerts the administrator.

                AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

                An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud. You specify an AMI when you launch an instance, and you can launch as many instances from the AMI as you need. You can also launch instances from as many different AMIs as you need.

                Amazon EMR helps you analyze and process vast amounts of data by distributing the computational work across a cluster of virtual servers running in the AWS Cloud. The cluster is managed using an open-source framework called Hadoop. Amazon EMR lets you focus on crunching or analyzing your data without having to worry about time-consuming setup, management, and tuning of Hadoop clusters or the compute capacity they rely on.

                Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

                There are two conventional architectures in which to deploy the Amazon Redshift data warehouse, as a single node which handles both client session and computations. The second as a multi node deployment. The latter consists of a leader node which receives queries and manages client connections to the database warehouse, whilst one or more compute nodes will store data and perform computations.

                Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible, relational database engine. It combines the speed and reliability of high- end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. It delivers up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications

                Subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.AWS provides two types of subnetting one is Public which allow the internet to access the machine and another is private which is hidden from the internet.

                Geolocation routing policy is particularly necessary when traffic to the hosted resources is meant to be routed according to originating source address. 
                weighted routing policy can distribute request traffic amongst resources 
                latency-based routing policy allows for queries to be served by the resources that have the smallest response times to the user’s location.
